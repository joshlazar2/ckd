Nephronophthisis 14 is a progressive condition characterized by chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis and cystic renal disease with significant variability related to the age of onset for kidney failure. Individuals with biallelic/likely pathogenic variants in ZNF423 can have isolated nephronophthisis or may have nephronophthisis with extrarenal features that may or may not constitute a recognizable syndrome. Joubert syndrome 19 is a multisystemic condition characterized by structural brain abnormality (molar tooth sign), hypotonia, and developmental delays. Other features include ophthalmological defects, episodic apnea/tachypnea, and hepatic fibrosis. Kidney abnormalities include nephronophthisis and polycystic kidneys, which can progress to kidney failure. MedGen UID: 761313.",
  "SCA (Sex Chromsome Abnormality)": "The presence of multiple duplicated [or deleted] genes on the X chromosome can be suggestive of a Sex Chromosome Abnormality (SCA). Clinical manifestations associated with each condition can include a variety of physical, developmental, and reproductive abnormalities. Variability can occur and chromosomal abnormality may or may not include renal abnormalities. Confirmatory cytogenic analysis is recommended. Clinical correlation is advised. \n\nMales born with an extra X chromosome (47, XXY) have Klinefelter syndrome which is a condition characterized by primary testicular insufficiency, distinct physical characteristics, and infertility. Kidney abnormalities may result as a complication related to diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. \n\nFemales born with a missing X chromosome (45,X) have Turner syndrome which is a condition characterized by primary ovarian insufficiency, distinct physical characteristics, and heart defects. Structural kidney abnormalities may occur. \n\nFemales born with an extra X chromosome (47,XXX) have Trisomy X syndrome. Most females with Trisomy X syndrome have normal health and development, but overall this condition is associated with a higher risk of learning delays, motor delays, and neurological abnormalities including hypotonia and seizures compared to the general population risk. Structural kidney abnormalities can occur including unilateral renal agenesis and renal dysplasia.",
  "Copy  Number Gain/Loss": "The presence of multiple duplicated or deleted genes on a single chromosome can suggest the presence of a Copy Number Variation (CNV). Clinical manifestations associated with CNVs may include a variety of physical and developmental abnormalities. The CNV identified may or may not represent part of a larger chromosomal aberration and identifying other clinically relevant genes is beyond the scope of this test. Confirmatory cytogenic analysis is recommended. Renal abnormalities may or may not be an associated feature with CNV reported. Clinical correlation is advised."
